deploy-awx-k3s-ubuntu

A quick way to deploy a single node k3s cluster running AWX.

Based on this article by Josphat Mutai:

https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-ansible-awx-on-ubuntu-linux/

Requirements
------------

Ubuntu 20.04/22.04

8 GB RAM

4 CPU

Role Variables
--------------

k3s_version: The k3s release to deploy, default is v1.21.9+k3s1 because I had

stability issues using later versions, your mileage may vary.


operator_version: The awx operator release, default 0.26.0

awx_version: AWX release, default 21.4.0


After testing multiple scenarios, I have found this combination to be rock solid.

Admin password
----------------

SSH into the host and run:

```
kubectl get secret awx-admin-password -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'

```

Example Playbook
----------------

deploy.yml can be used to execute against an inventory

ansible-playbook -i YourInventoryFile deploy.yml

This repo can also be imported into an existing AWX/Tower instance as a project
